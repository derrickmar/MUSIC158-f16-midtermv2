Play certain sounds based on the emotion and other features of an image.

## Main idea
There are two major components of this project:
- Android app (./Sample directory)
    - Used to take a picture
    - Analyze the emotion of the picture using [Microsoft's Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api)
    - Calculate the RGB values of random pixels in the image to play certain sounds based on the emotion.
- Max patch (midtermv1.maxpat)
    - The Max patch receives the identified emotion and sound indexes generated by the Android app via UDP (we use [Java-OSC](http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html) for this)
    - Using the concepts we learned in class, it plays certain sounds related to the emotion!

## Instructions
To run the app you'll have to build from source (./Sample)
Follow the comments in the max patch to add the sounds in the ./sounds directory
